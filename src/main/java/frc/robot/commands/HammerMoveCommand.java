/**
 * The HammerMoveCommand class controls the hammer subsystem by applying speed based on joystick input.
 * It is a command in the WPILib Command-based framework.
 *
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Read joystick input (speed supplier) and apply speed to the hammer subsystem.
 * - Stop the hammer when the command ends.
 *
 * Key Components:
 * - Subsystem: HammerSubsystem.
 * - Input: DoubleSupplier for joystick speed.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 * - `initialize()`: Called once when the command starts.
 * - `execute()`: Called repeatedly while the command is active.
 * - `end()`: Called once when the command ends or is interrupted.
